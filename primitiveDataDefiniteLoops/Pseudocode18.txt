Create method that prints ( |   |   | ) call it pipesLine
print plusEqualsLine
print pipesLine
print pipesLine
print pipesLine
print plusEqualsLine
print pipesLine
print pipesLine
print pipesLine
print plusEqualsLine

Loops pseudocode:

for (twice looped write) {
    write on its own line ( +===+===+ )
        for (three loops) {
        write  ( |   |   | )
        }
