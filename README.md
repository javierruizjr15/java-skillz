              /\
3. WellFormed: Write a complete Java program called WellFormed that prints the following output:
            A well–formed Java program has
            a main method with { and }
            braces.

            A System.out.println statement
            has ( and ) and usually a
            String that starts and ends
            with a " character.
            (But we type \" instead!)
4. Difference: Write a complete Java program called Difference that prints the following output:
            What is the difference between
            a ' and a "? Or between a " and a \"?
            One is what we see when we're typing our program.
            The other is what appears on the "console."
5. MuchBetter: Write a complete Java program called MuchBetter that prints the following output:
            A "quoted" String is
            'much' better if you learn

            Also, "" represents an empty String.
            Don't forget: use \" instead of " !
            '' is not the same as "
6. Meta: Write a complete Java program called Meta whose output is the text that would be the source code of a Java program that prints 
            “Hello, world!” as its output.
7. Mantra: Write a complete Java program called Mantra that prints the following output. Use at least one static method besides main.
