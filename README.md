Exercises

1. Physics: In physics, a common useful equation for finding the position s of a body in linear motion at a given time t, based on its initial position s0, initial velocity v0, and rate of acceleration a, is the following:
            s = s0 + v0t + 1/2at^2
    Write code to declare variables for s0, v0, a, and t, and then write the code to compute s on the basis of these values.
